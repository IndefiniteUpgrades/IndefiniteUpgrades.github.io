    <h1>Awakening</h1>
    <hr />
    <div class="text-container">
      <p>You wake up disoriented and surrounded by darkness. As you slowly open your eyes and they adjust to the dim light, you realize that you are lying in the middle of a far-stretching meadow. You stick your hands against the ground and sit up. The grass is dense and seems almost turquoise.</p>

      <p>You press the gas mask tightly against your face in fear that it might let some unfiltered air in. The world outside is contaminated, and this mask, along with your hazmat suit, is your lifeline. You take a deep breath, hoping to find relief in the filtered air, but it&#39;s not as easy as you expected. Your lungs strain against the resistance, and the oxygen feels scarce. Each breath is a struggle, as if the mask and suit are holding back the very air you desperately need. Your chest tightens, and panic starts to creep in. You fight to control your breath, but the more you try, the harder it becomes. You remind yourself to stay calm and to ration your breaths, but the difficulty persists. The world around you blurs as you focus on each labored breath, desperately hoping for a moment of respite&mdash;a moment when you can finally breathe freely again. But for now, you press on, knowing that this discomfort is a small price to pay for survival in a world poisoned by toxic air.</p>
      
      <p>Your head throbs with a dull ache, and as you try to piece together your memories, flashes of the catastrophic events that led to this devastation flood your mind. The world had descended into chaos, torn apart by a devastating war that unleashed the destructive power of nuclear weapons.</p>

      <div class="text-container">

      <p>As you struggle to stand up, your body feels weak and battered, but a flicker of determination ignites within you. You refuse to succumb to despair. You are one of the survivors, resilient and determined to find hope amidst the desolation.</p>
      <p>You take a moment to gather your strength and survey your surroundings. The remnants of buildings loom far away in the distance, their skeletal frames standing as haunting reminders of what once was. You try to remember what happened and how you got here, but your desperate attempt fails as your head throbs with pain once again.</p>
