    <h1>Further Along The River</h1>
    <hr />
    <div class="text-container">
      <div class="text-container">
        <p>Driven by curiosity, you decide to continue following the river, wanting to see where it leads. The gentle flow of the water becomes your guide, guiding your steps as you move upstream.</p>
        
        <p>As you walk alongside the river, you notice the landscape gradually changing. The once luscious and green surroundings start disappearing into barren and lifeless rocks.</p>
        
        <p>As you venture further up the river, the terrain becomes more rugged, and the river transforms into a narrow gorge. The water rushes through the narrow passage, creating a symphony of rushing sounds that resonate within you.</p>
        
        <p>You carefully navigate the rocky terrain, each step taken with caution. The journey is challenging, but you persevere, driven by the desire to uncover the mysteries that lie ahead.</p>
        
        <p>After what feels like hours of trekking, the gorge begins to widen, and the river calms into a tranquil pool. A breathtaking sight awaits you as you reach an open clearing. Before you stretches a lush oasis, a sanctuary nestled amidst the chaos.</p>
        
        <p>Tall trees with vibrant leaves provide shade, their branches swaying gently in the breeze. The air is filled with the fragrance of blossoming flowers, carrying a delicate sweetness that captivates your senses even through your mask.</p>
        
        <p>You find a spot near the water's edge and sit down, allowing the serenity of the oasis to envelop you. The sound of the flowing river and the chorus of nature's melodies bring a sense of peace that you haven't felt in a long time.</p>

         <p>  As you sit down quietly, you start to hear a faint humming sound. You look around, but can't see the source of the sound. Then, suddenly an improvised looking aircraft hovers above you, about 50 meters above ground. The aircraft seems to have a white skull drawn on the underside. It does not seem to have spotted you yet.</p>
  
        <p>Your heart races with a mixture of curiosity and caution. What is this drone doing here in the midst of the desolation? Could it be a sign of life, a sign of survivors? You contemplate whether to hide or to make your presence known.</p>
