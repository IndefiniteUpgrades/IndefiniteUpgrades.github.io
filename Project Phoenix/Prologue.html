    <h1>Prologue</h1>
    <hr />
    <div class="text-container">
      <p>In the history of humanity, there are parts that remind us of our destructive tendencies. This is the story of the aftermath from 2037, the year when the world came the closest to complete destruction because of a terrible war that involved nuclear weapons.</p>
      <p>The cause of this global tragedy can be traced back to increasing tensions and disagreements among nations. What started as small disagreements grew into big differences in beliefs and power. Governments struggled to find solutions that would satisfy their people.</p>
      <p>In the pursuit of power, diplomacy was abandoned, and nations hid their true intentions behind pretense. They had been engaged in a deadly competition for a long time. The growing disagreements were bound to lead to a catastrophe, and that's what happened when nuclear weapons were deployed.</p>
      <p>On that fateful day, as night fell, the world was shaken by a series of missile attacks that caused widespread death and destruction. Cities turned into fiery infernos, and entire populations were completely wiped out. The War spread across continents, leaving behind landscapes polluted by radiation. It was humanity's darkest hour.</p>

      <p>The survivors were left to face a world they couldn&#39;t recognize; their lives were shattered amidst the ruins of civilization. With governments destroyed and systems of order in chaos, humanity held on to a glimmer of hope, struggling to survive after the catastrophe.</p>

      <p>But the horrors didn&#39;t end with the initial devastation. After the nuclear disaster, hunger and disease became relentless enemies. Resources became scarce, ecosystems suffered, and desperation led to a slow and painful decline.</p>
      
      <p>Some people resorted to extreme measures, stabbing their fellow survivors in the back in an attempt to secure their own survival. Trust, which used to be the foundation of society, became rare as people were afraid of being betrayed. In this broken world, humanity faced the consequences of its actions, burdened by the knowledge that this apocalypse was caused by its own hands.</p>
      
      <p>However, amidst the ruins, a story of resilience and redemption emerged. Those who remained, scarred and broken, refused to give in to despair. They started a journey to rebuild the shattered world, finding comfort in the fragments of hope.</p>
      
      <p>As the sun set on what was left of a once thriving civilization, the survivors faced an uncertain future, grappling with the grim consequences of their choices. The scars of the nuclear war were deep, visible on the land and in the hearts of those who survived. From this crucible of devastation, the story of humanity&#39;s redemption would rise, a flickering light in the darkness, reclaiming a future stolen by the conflict&#39;s aftermath.</p> </div>
